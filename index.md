Hi!

I'm Marko Laharnar, __programmer/game developer entrepreneur__. I offer a wide range of __custom made applications or games__ that are based on Unity(Windows, Android), .NET, including VR and AR based applications. I can also through different contacts accept work for audio production, video production, 2d art, 3d art.

I've started as __hobby game developer of 6 years__ working in different areas of game development, from 3D, some 2D and mainly programming. By working at Pubfinity I recieved some experience with entrepreneurship which led me to decision to offer my services this way.

My experince consists first, of working at Pubfinity, working with Vaadin framework as support for ad intergration for their new SDK as junior developer over S.P. in their expanding team.

And second, from working at Obƒçina Trbovlje/Delavski dom Trbovlje, on __escape room "Pobeg iz rudnika"__, primarily as main programmer working on puzzle design, app development, VR team management, AR, RaspberryPI and server/client development.
Additionally i've gotten experience with finances, project management and head hunting. I've been part of the team from day 1, from preproduction to the end of the project.

Lately i've been focusing on improving my development skills, team management, project management and trying to help people expand their skills. What's left of my time, I use on my diploma, application for experimental approach to 2d pixel animation using 3d and vector animation techniques.

### Outfit7 Talent camp or other tests

I participated in 2 Talent camps 2017 and 2019, at Outfit7, Ekipa2 subsidiary, in Ljubljana. Both in 2017 and 2019, I was filling a role of a game developer.
Outfit7 offers these camps as sort of intern/workshop. A lot of people apply, also from other countries.
2017, forest-sprit platformer, inspired by Ori and the Blind Forest, made in 2 weeks in team of 7.
2019, mobile game where you turn the phone to get the falling character through the level, made in 4 days.

Following are two small games I did as part of entry tests for Talent camp 2017 and 2018. Since 2019 tests weren't done.
